# Digit_Classification_Using_ML
# Objective:

Develop a machine learning system to accurately classify digits (0-9) based on 298 features extracted from binary images.

The dataset comprises various attribute files, including Fourier coefficients capturing shape details (mfeat-fou), profile correlations (mfeat-fac), and morphological features (mfeat-mor). 

Explore various classification algorithms, optimize hyperparameters using grid search, and assess model performance through cross-validation.

Emphasize best practices in data preprocessing, regularization, and model evaluation to achieve robust and accurate digit classification.
